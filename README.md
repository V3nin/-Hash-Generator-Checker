# 🔑 Hash Generator & Checker

A lightweight and educational **hash generator**, developed by me (p8pc).

This project allows users to generate cryptographic hashes from text input and understand how hashing algorithms are used in cybersecurity to ensure data integrity and security.

It is designed to demonstrate the basics of hashing in a simple and visual way.

### Designed for:

* Cybersecurity learning 🛡️
* Hashing and data integrity concepts 🔐
* Developers and students 👨‍💻
* Educational demonstrations 📚

### Features

* Generate cryptographic hashes from text
* Supported algorithms:
  * MD5
  * SHA-1
  * SHA-256
* Instant hash generation
* Clean graphical interface with custom background
* Lightweight and easy to use
* Runs fully offline

### Installation

No installation required.

This project is distributed as a **standalone Windows executable (.exe)**.  
Python and dependencies are already included in the executable.

### Usage

1. Download the `.exe` file.
2. Double-click to launch the application.
3. Enter text in the input field.
4. Select the hashing algorithm.
5. Click **Generate** to obtain the hash.

### Security Notes

* This tool does **not** reverse or crack hashes
* No data is stored, logged, or transmitted
* Runs entirely offline
* Intended for **educational and awareness purposes**
